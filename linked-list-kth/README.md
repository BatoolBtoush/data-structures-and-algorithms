# Challenge Summary
You're asked to return the k-th value from the end of a linked list,
by having a method inside the LinkedList class that takes an int of k.

**input:** k integer

**output:** the equvilant k-th value or node form the LinkedList

## Approach & Efficiency

Create a length method to calculate the length of the linked list:
Create a find_kth method that takes an input of the object created by the LinkedList class which is an actual linked list, and a kth number.
and must output or return appropriate equivalent values, either the equivalent node to the kth number of an expectation.
Initiate 2 pointers, both of them point to the head node to start from there.

**Big O:** traversing through the linked list is of O(n)
so the time complexity is O(n)
space complexity O(1)


## Solution
The solution and examples of it are in the white board process
