# Reverse an Array

The code challenge gives a problem domain of, writing a function that takes an array of integers as an input and returns a reversed array.

While going through the steps of what's ***Whiteboard Process***, which helps solves the problem domain in an easy approach that can be understood by many, even if they don't get a certain programming language.

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach I took for solving this code challenge is **swapping**, which means to interchange between the indeces inside the array. 

The first index and the last,

The second index and the index before the last,

And so on.

Making sure that the swapping stops if the start index becomes greater than the end index.



**The Big O for this approcah was:**

time <--- O(n)

space <--- O(1)
