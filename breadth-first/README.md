## **Approach & Efficiency**
***Approach:***
- Create an empty queue
- Start from root and appeand it into the queue
- Loop while root is not TRUE:
    b) Enqueue rootâ€™s children into the queue
      starting from left to right children
    c) Dequeue a node from the queue

***Big O:***

- Time Complexity: O(n) 
- Space Complexity: O(n)
